## What is a URL slug?

A **URL slug** is the part of a URL that identifies a particular page on a website in a readable, user-friendly format. It's typically the last part of the URL and comes after the domain name and any subdirectories.

For example, in the URL:

```
https://www.example.com/blog/what-is-a-url-slug
```

- The domain name is `www.example.com`.
- The slug is `what-is-a-url-slug`.

### Key Characteristics of a URL Slug:
- **Readable**: A slug is often a short, descriptive string that makes it easy for users to understand the content of the page just by looking at the URL.
- **SEO-friendly**: Slugs are optimized for search engines (SEO) by including relevant keywords that describe the page content.
- **Lowercase and hyphenated**: Slugs typically use lowercase letters and hyphens (`-`) to separate words, avoiding spaces, special characters, and uppercase letters.

### Purpose of URL Slugs:
- **Improves User Experience**: Users can easily remember and understand the content of a page by glancing at the URL.
- **Enhances SEO**: Search engines use slugs as part of the URL structure to index and rank pages, making it an important aspect of SEO.

A URL slug is the part of the URL that makes it clear and easy to understand what a webpage is about, while also contributing to better search engine ranking.
